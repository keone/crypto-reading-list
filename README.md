* [How the Bitcoin protocol actually works](https://michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-the-bitcoin-protocol-actually-works/) (Michael Nielsen, 2013) - 
  describing Bitcoin's mechanics, building it up from first principles

## Why is crypto important?
* [Bitcoin for the open-minded skeptic](https://www.matthuang.com/bitcoin_for_the_open_minded_skeptic) (Matt Huang, 2020)
* [Why decentralization matters](https://cdixon.org/2018/02/18/why-decentralization-matters) (Chris Dixon, 2018) - 
  discusses the pattern of new technology progressing from innovation to extraction (from cooperation with their ecosystem to eventual competition),
  such as Apple initially encouraging developers to build on iOS, to now charging 30% on all in-store purchases.  Discusses how crypto solves this 
  by aligning the network with its participants.
* [Crypto tokens: a breakthrough in open design](https://cdixon.org/2017/05/27/crypto-tokens-a-breakthrough-in-open-network-design) (Chris Dixon, 2017) - 
  tokens as an enabler for alignment between networks and their participants
