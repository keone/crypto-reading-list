  EIP-1559 was a major UX change to how Ethereum would set gas price.  At the time there was much
  debate about whether miners would accept these changes which would reduce their revenue.  Hasu and
  Georgios correctly predicted the result (see also
  [this article](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/miners-will-accept-eip-1559-here-is-why/))
