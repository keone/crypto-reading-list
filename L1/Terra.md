## Ecosystem
* [Terra Project Listing from Smart Stake](https://terra.smartstake.io/projects)
* [Nebula](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gcCKdjnZTtIGmG97y5enr_erQK3fK8z97_OtbT7KDao/edit) -
a protocol for "ETFs", where the target asset mix is dynamically changing via smart contracts (there are incentives to make actual asset mix = target).
Do Kwon asserts a fascinating hypothesis: young investors want to make bets, not passively invest.
* [Mirror](https://docs.mirror.finance/protocol/mirrored-assets-massets) -
mirror real-world assets (e.g. $mAAPL) on Terra and Ethereum / BSC via Shuttle.
note: currently [under investigation by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2021/lr25262.htm)
* [Shuttle](https://github.com/terra-money/shuttle) -
bidirection transfer of Terra assets <-> Ethereum / BSC. *note: README is out-of-date as it supports BSC too now.*
[Terra Bridge](https://bridge.terra.money/) provides a UI.
