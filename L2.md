L2
====

## Intro / Survey
* [L2 for Beginners](https://gourmetcrypto.substack.com/p/layer-2-for-beginners) -
  describing a mental model of an L2 as a chain which writes enough state back to Ethereum that
  no one (including the L2's miners/validators) can send back a fraudulent state
* [Eth docs on L2 Rollups](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/layer-2-rollups/) - see the bottom of this page for further links
* [Optimistic rollups vs ZK-rollups](https://limechain.tech/blog/optimistic-rollups-vs-zk-rollups/) -
  a recent assessment of the state of various rollup projects
* [Vitalik's post on rollups](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) - a fairly technical summary of the SOTW of rollups
* [Validating Bridges](https://stonecoldpat.github.io/images/validatingbridges.pdf) (Sep 2021) -
  a fairly thorough assessment of L2 solutions (including Oasis?) as well as open research questions

## Optimistic rollups
* [Optimistic rollups: Arbitrum vs Optimism](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/making-sense-of-rollups-part-2-dispute-resolution-on-arbitrum-and-optimism/)

## zk-Rollups
* [Validity Proofs vs Fraud Proofs](https://medium.com/starkware/validity-proofs-vs-fraud-proofs-4ef8b4d3d87a) (2019) - 
  StarkWare's summary of fraud proofs (typically employed by optimistic rollups) vs validity proofs (not feasible on optimistic rollups)
* [zk-STARKS vs zk-SNARKS](https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/zero-knowledge-proofs-starks-vs-snarks/)
* [ethhub ZK-STARKS](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-starks/)
* [StarkWare](https://medium.com/starkware/on-the-road-to-starknet-a-permissionless-stark-powered-l2-zk-rollup-83be53640880) (Jan 2021) -
  StartWare's description of their STARK-powered zk-rollup
* [zkSync](https://blog.matter-labs.io/zksync-is-live-bringing-trustless-scalable-payments-to-ethereum-9c634b3e6823) (June 2020) -
  Matter Labs' description of their zk-rollup
* [Volitions: best of all worlds](https://polynya.medium.com/volitions-best-of-all-worlds-cfd313aec9a8) (Aug 2021) -
  describing the *volition*, a hybrid system where users can choose between storing their data as a rollup (on-chain 
  data) or as a validium (off-chain).
  * See also StarkWare's [proposal](https://medium.com/starkware/volition-and-the-emerging-data-availability-spectrum-87e8bfa09bb) (June 2020)
