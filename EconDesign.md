Economic Design
================

On this page we'll try to collect resources about interesting protocol designs

## Incentive design
There is much discussion (e.g. on Twitter) about the security implications of various blockchains'
economic designs.  The below links give a taste of the considerations, although they are certainly
not complete:
* [Blockchain Resource Pricing](https://github.com/ethereum/research/blob/master/papers/pricing/ethpricing.pdf)
* [Staking Pools, Staking Derivatives, and Eth2.0 Security](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/04/on-staking-pools-and-staking-derivatives/)

## Protocol design
* [Liquidity Mining on UniV3](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/05/liquidity-mining-on-uniswap-v3/) -
  describing the history of on-chain computation of liquidity mining rewards (pioneered by SNX for their sETH Uniswap
  pool), formulated nicely for computation only when pool balances change
